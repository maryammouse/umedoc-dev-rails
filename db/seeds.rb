# If you need to create the database on another system, you should be using
# db:seed, not running all the migrations from scratch. The latter is a flawed
# and unsustainable approach (the more migrations you'll amass, the slower
# it'll run and the greater likelihood for issues).
#
# It's strongly recommended to check this file into your version control system.
